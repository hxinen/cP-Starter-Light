###Custom Style Installation###
A couple things before you start.  First, identify the type of role that best suits your needs in order to complete the installation. Secondly, cP Starter is compatible to **cPanel & WHM 56 or later**.   

1. Download and extract the files
2. Rename cP-Starter-Light to anything you want, if you prefer since I've fixed the paths of the files.
3. Place the extracted files in a new folder called cP_Starter_Light (or to anything you want) and upload them in the following directory: 
*(Note: if the directory folders do not exist, create them in the right order)*

    - **Server**: 
        + `/var/cpanel/customizations/styled/cP_Starter_Light/`
        
    - **Reseller**: 
        + `/home/reseller/var/cpanel/reseller/styled/cP_Starter_Light/` *(Note: reseller - represents the cPanel account's reseller's username)*
        
    - **cPanel User**: 
        + `/home/username/var/cpanel/styled/cP_Starter_Light/` *(Note: username - represents the cPanel account's username)*

4. Generate custom icons via command line: 
(Note: this is optional as it replaces existing icons)

    - **Both Server & Reseller**:
        + Log in to the server via SSH as a root or reseller user
        + Run the command line: 
            - `/usr/local/cpanel/bin/sprite_generator --theme paper_lantern --style cP_Starter_Light`

5. Change your style interface:

    - **Server**:
        + Log in to the server via SSH as the root user
        + Run the command: 
            - `ln -s /var/cpanel/customizations/styled/cP_Starter_Light /var/cpanel/customizations/styled/default_style` 
            *(Note: This sets the default for all new accounts. It does not modify any existing accounts. To do so, you will need to change default style under “cPanel User” instruction.)*
            
    - **Reseller**: 
        + Login to cPanel
        + Navigate to Change Style: Home >> Preferences >> Change Style
        + Select “Set as Default” to apply every cPanel account or select “Apply” for specific account.
        
    - **cPanel User**:
        + Login to cPanel
        + Navigate to cPanel Style: Home >> Preferences >> Change Style
        + Click “Apply”

5. Change cPanel default logo to your own brand logo:

    - **Both Server and Reseller**:
        + Login to WHM
        + Navigate to Branding:  cPanel > Branding 
        + Upload your logo under Company Logo
